# URCL
All official URCL documentation can be found in the `Release` folder, these are **.pdf** files.

## Information
URCL is a simple universal intermediate language. It is designed to be as similar as possible to typical RISC assembly in order to make it as easy as possible to translate to any specific assembly language.

## Documentation Releases
The **.pdf** files marked with a specific URCL version number should never be updated but files marked as `"Unnamed"` are subject to future updates.

This means that, all URCL projects should specify the exact version of URCL they use to prevent them breaking in the future.

## Errors or Contradictions
If there are any errors or contradictions between this documentation and any other documentation for URCL, the offical version found here should be defined as the correct version.

## How to edit/contribute
1) Create a fork or clone of this repository
2) Use Microsoft Word to edit the **.docx** files located in the `Source` folder
3) Export the changed documentation as a **.pdf**

Alternatively you can create an issue and someone else can fix it at a later date.
